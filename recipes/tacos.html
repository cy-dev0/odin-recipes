        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Protein:

                If using ground beef, heat a skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook until browned. Drain excess fat if needed.
                For shredded chicken, you can cook chicken breasts in a pot of boiling water until cooked through. Shred the chicken using two forks.
                If using other proteins like shrimp, pork, tofu, or tempeh, follow specific cooking instructions accordingly.
                Season the cooked protein with taco seasoning or your preferred spices and marinades for extra flavor. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Toppings and Fillings:

                Chop and prepare your desired toppings and fillings such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, avocado or guacamole, cheese, sour cream or Mexican crema, salsa, cilantro, and lime wedges. Place them in separate bowls for easy assembly.</li>
            <li>Warm the Tortillas:

                Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat.
                Warm each tortilla for about 10-15 seconds on each side until they become pliable.
                You can also warm the tortillas in a microwave or oven wrapped in a damp paper towel or aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Assemble the Tacos:

                Take a warm tortilla and place a portion of the cooked protein in the center.
                Add your desired toppings and fillings on top of the protein.
                Squeeze some lime juice over the fillings for an extra zing.
                Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas and ingredients.</li>
            <li>Serve and Enjoy:

                Arrange the assembled tacos on a serving platter.
                You can garnish with additional toppings such as sliced radishes, pickled onions, cotija cheese, or hot sauce.
                Serve the tacos immediately while still warm.
                Enjoy your delicious homemade tacos!</li>
