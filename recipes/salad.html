        <h1>How to make Odin's third favorite dish: Salad!<h1>
        <img src="../img/salad.jpg" alt="Salad">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Odin's Salad is a divine culinary creation that pays homage to the Norse god of wisdom and knowledge, Odin. This extraordinary salad is a tantalizing blend of fresh and vibrant ingredients that nourish both the body and the spirit. Crisp greens form the foundation, symbolizing the lush fields of Valhalla, while the addition of roasted beets represents the earthy essence of Yggdrasil, the great world tree. Pomegranate seeds, with their jewel-like appearance, mirror the wisdom and insight sought by Odin himself. To complete the experience, a drizzle of tangy citrus dressing awakens the senses and adds a touch of divine brightness. Odin's Salad is not only a delightful culinary adventure but also a tribute to the ancient Norse mythology, bringing a taste of the gods to the modern-day palate.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and prepare the lettuce or mixed salad greens by rinsing them thoroughly under cold water. Pat them dry or use a salad spinner to remove excess moisture. Tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces and place them in a large salad bowl.</li>

            <li>Rinse the tomatoes and cucumbers under cold water. Slice the tomatoes into halves or quarters, depending on their size. Peel and chop the cucumbers into bite-sized pieces. Add them to the salad bowl.</li>

            <li>Peel the carrots and rinse them under cold water. Use a grater or a vegetable peeler to shred or thinly slice the carrots. Add them to the bowl.</li>

            <li>Peel the red onions or shallots and slice them thinly. If you prefer milder onion flavor, soak the sliced onions in cold water for a few minutes, then drain. Add the sliced onions to the salad bowl.</li>

            <li>Rinse the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Slice the peppers into thin strips or bite-sized pieces. Add them to the bowl.</li>

            <li>Rinse the radishes and trim off the ends. Slice them thinly and add them to the bowl.</li>

            <li>If using avocado, cut it in half, remove the pit, and slice or dice the flesh. Gently scoop out the avocado pieces and add them to the bowl.</li>

            <li>Drain and rinse the olives, if necessary. You can keep them whole or slice them. Add them to the bowl.</li>

            <li>If using feta cheese or goat cheese, crumble it into the salad bowl. Adjust the amount according to your preference.</li>

            <li>At this point, you can also add any optional ingredients like grilled chicken breast, hard-boiled eggs, bacon bits, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, herbs, grains, beans, corn kernels, or sprouts.</li>

            <li>Drizzle the salad dressing of your choice over the ingredients in the bowl. Start with a small amount and add more as needed. Toss the salad gently to distribute the dressing evenly.</li>

            <li>Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can add a pinch of salt and pepper, or any additional herbs or spices to enhance the flavors.</li>

            <li>Serve the salad immediately as a side dish or add a protein source like grilled chicken to make it a complete meal.</li>
