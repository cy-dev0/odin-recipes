        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
            <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 3/4 cups (490 g) bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle yeast over lukewarm water in a small bowl. Sprinkle sugar on top. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast is foamy and dissolved. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Using a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the side of the bowl. </li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down and use as directed in the pizza recipe. </li>
        </ol>
